#+title: sum Queries

Typical queries are range sum queries (calculating the sum of values) and
range minimum queries (finding the minimum value).

** Queries on Static Arrays
- we focus on a situation where the array is static, i.e., the array values
are never updated between the queries. In this case, it suffices to preprocess the array
so that we can efficiently answer range queries.
*** Sum Queries:
 - prefix sum :
    - sumq (a, b) = sumq (0, b) - sumq (0, a - 1).

 - 2 dimension array:
   - S(X) = S(A) - S(B) - S(C) + S(D).
     X : the sum of values in a rectangular subarray from the upper-left
         corner to the position of X.
     A : sum of value from (0,0) to corner to the postion of X.
